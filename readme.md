## Full text search engine



This project leverages Node.js and Redis to create a powerful search engine capable of efficiently querying the vast IMDb movie dataset with 10000 movies. By employing the inverted index technique, this search engine allows users to quickly retrieve relevant movie names based on their search queries. Whether you're looking for your favorite movies, actors, directors, or genres, our search engine provides lightning-fast results, making it easy to explore the IMDb dataset with ease. With its intuitive interface and high-performance backend, this project showcases the capabilities of Node.js and Redis in handling large-scale datasets and delivering seamless search experiences.


## How does this work?
This search engine has been built on the fundamentals of inverted indexing; this technique has also been used in ElasticSearch.


It works by creating an index that maps each unique term in the dataset to the documents or records that contain that term.



## What steps are involved in this search engine?


1) Tokenization
2) Inverted Index Creation
3) Indexing Process
4) Query Processing
5) Results Presentation


Further improvements can be made by adding the ranking feature.
